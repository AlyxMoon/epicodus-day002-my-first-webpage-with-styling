        <h2>Thailand</h2>

      </div>
      <p>I don't know much about Thailand, only my experience when I was there. Most of all I remember the food. When the sun begins setting, the streets come alive with the sounds and smells of vendors everywhere preparing food. Either from more permanent stalls or their own personal mopeds decked out with a cooking attachment. My stomach was happy every moment I was there, and if the stomach is happy the soul is happy.</p>

        <h2>Taiwan</h2>

      <p>The Republic of China (Taiwan) is situated in the West Pacific between Japan and the Philippines. Its jurisdiction extends to the archipelagoes of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, as well as numerous other islets. The total area of Taiwan proper and its outlying islands is around 36,197 square kilometers. </p>

        <h2>Japan</h2>
        <img src="img/places/japan.webp" alt="photo of Japan">
      </div>
      <p>Japan is a place where you get to eat in the isolation of your own space. Especially when you can not only order food through a vending machine, but you can also eat in your own little cubby of privacy.</p>

      <p>A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances.</p>

      <p>After a long day of exploration and fun, there's no better place to be then snuggled up on your couch at home.</p>
